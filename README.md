# flic-client

Client library for the Flic linux daemon, ported to Typescript and Promises from the official one

## Why?

Because the [original one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/50ButtonsEach/fliclib-linux-hci/master/clientlib/nodejs/fliclibNodeJs.js) is lacking types, and uses callbacks, and I don't like that ðŸ‘Ž

## Requirements

Uses Typescript compilation
